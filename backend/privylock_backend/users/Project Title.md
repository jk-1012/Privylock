Project Title
Safarix: A Unified Smart Travel Booking and City-Based Local Guide Assistance Platform
Project Abstract
Safarix is a unified web-based travel booking and assistance application designed to simplify the travel experience by integrating bus, train, and flight booking services along with city-based local guide interaction into a single platform.
A key feature of Safarix is the city-based chat system, where users can select a destination city and directly communicate with verified local guides. Through this in-app chat functionality, travelers can ask questions related to local attractions, transportation, food, safety, culture, and hidden places, helping them make informed decisions and enjoy a better travel experience.
Safarix provides essential functionalities such as real-time availability checking, fare comparison, secure online payment processing, digital ticket generation, and booking management. The system is developed using a Django-based backend to ensure scalability, data security, and reliable performance.
